agent.currentWeather(CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 39.961176, longitude: -82.998794)) { result in
  let city: City = result.data()!
	// Do something with the current weather forecast city object here
}
```

To get the weather forecast for a specific location:

```swift
let agent = WeatherKitAgent(apiKey: "your_api_key")
agent.dailyForecast(CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 39.961176, longitude: -82.998794)) { result in
  let city: City = result.data()!
	// Do something with the forecast dictionary here
}
```

To get conditions for a specified number of cities near a specific location:

```swift
let agent = WeatherKitAgent(apiKey: "your_api_key")
agent.citiesInCycle(CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 39.961176, longitude: -82.998794), numberOfCities: 10) { result in
  let city: City = result.data()!
